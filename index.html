Hi, I'm Asiye Kaymaz Özcanlı. I am an electrical engineer and researcher interested in power systems, microgrids, renewable energy integration, and data-driven energy analytics. I completed my B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at Yıldız Technical University, and I previously worked as a visiting postdoctoral researcher at Carnegie Mellon University in the Engineering and Public Policy department.

I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Fatih Sultan Mehmet University. My recent work focuses on machine-learning-based energy forecasting, outage probability modeling, battery resilience studies, and the integration of AI techniques into modern power systems. I enjoy working with real-world datasets and developing practical solutions that support grid reliability and the transition to cleaner energy systems.

<p>
I am open to collaboration on topics related to power systems and machine learning applications in energy systems.
